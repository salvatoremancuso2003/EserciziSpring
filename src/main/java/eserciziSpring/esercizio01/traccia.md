    write a Spring Boot application with the necessary dependencies that has:
        a NameController where you map name in order to:
            reply with your name to a GET request
            reply with your reversed name (e.g. from John to nhoJ, using StringBuilder) to a POST request
    test the API endpoint with Postman, executing a GET and a POST request
