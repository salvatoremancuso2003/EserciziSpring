    write a Spring Boot application with the necessary dependencies that:
        mocks a database using h2 that has username:testdb and password:psw1234
        creates a table Student with:
            a primary key
            a firstName
            a lastName
            a unique email
    use the h2-console with your browser and connect to the db
        you should see something like the h2-pic.PNG (you may find it in the folder) in the browser
